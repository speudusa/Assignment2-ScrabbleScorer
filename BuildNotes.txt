5/24 ------

    BROKEN: updated VS (doh) and now my code from Friday won't work.
        * BUT, this is okay.  Now I have the same version of VS they will have
            AND the same NuGET packages as they do (none)
        This will be a more legit test for the over all assignment as it will match their specs at this point

    PLANS:  Rebuild code from Friday.

    MAIN BRANCH -- will be one long loop, no methods yet.
        * make branches when trying to make methods.  Do ONE for EACH method.  <-- yes!

    REBUILT and WORKING! :) :D XD
        now to push it up to GH...
