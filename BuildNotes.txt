5/24 ------

5 methods all together

each method is connected to each other some how

WelcomeProgram()
    >> ScoreProgram(string option)
        >> 1. ScrabbleScorer(string word) || 2. SimpleScorer(string word) || 3. BonusVowels(string word)


All methods are static, built outside the Main method, but within the same Program class

All methods are void

----------------------
Build notes

I started with while block and if/else blocks
create a working program without any methods

recommend starting with that then reconfiguring into methods

might have that as the starter code???

or would that be confusing???
